        I've been working as a Web Developer since December 2020. I'm interested
        in technologies that built on top of JavaScript. I'm currently working
        as a Associate Web Developer at Plus One Robotics in San Antonio, USA. I
        love watching movies, hiking and playing video games with my friends in
        my free time.
